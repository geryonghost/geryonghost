- 👋 Hi, I’m @geryonghost
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud architecture, cloud security, bicycling, and LEGO. I am writing a Node.js and MongoDB based weather application inside of Docker to enhance my learning. 
- 🌱 My current role has me focused on Terraform primarily managing IAM in GCP. When there is time I am testing my hands in GitHub Actions, Kuberbetes, and much much more. Although I am focused in GCP today, I have experience in AWS and Azure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things Github, Terraform, and GCP. When my comfort level with contributing to public repositories increases, I hope to support my favorite tools (opentf.org).
